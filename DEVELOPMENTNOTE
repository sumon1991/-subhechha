Updating the total payable money on edit order(out of the box).(Done & Stable).

Bug Issue : after editing the order in order details tab after saving rather it's not redirecting to the right page (Not Fixed Out of the box).
//=========================
Changes on Release V1.1
1. Please remove the PDF icon from payment log.

2. After payment updated it should be redirected into the same page. Currently its going to different page which is wrong.

3. Instead of showing order id please show the date, purpose and location of the order.

4. Update text field should have some validation otherwise a mess will happen. if you see 2nd order log you can understand the situation. If my due is 100 I can't put 500 into the update text box because it greater than the due amount.
